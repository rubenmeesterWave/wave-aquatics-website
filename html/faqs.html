        <h3>Wave Swim School Student Policies</h3>
        <h5>MEDICALLY EXCUSED ABSENCE POLICY</h5>
        <p>Credits will only be given for medically excused absences. Families may submit a doctor’s note or proof of a positive covid test to receive a credit for an absence. This must be submitted within 7 days of the absence. We will accept proof of a positive covid test for any member of the household, not just the student.</p>
        <h5>RELIGIOUS HOLIDAY POLICY</h5>
        <p>If the student will be missing one lesson due to a religious holiday, families may request a credit at the time of registration for that session. </p>
        <p>If the student will be missing multiple lessons due to an extended religious holiday, families may submit a request before the session to maintain their priority registration status. If this is the case, families will not enroll for the upcoming session.</p>
        <h5>WAVE SWIM SCHOOL RIGHT TO REMOVAL POLICY</h5>
        <p>Wave Swim School reserves the right to remove any student from their class if they are hindering the learning of other students. Reasons a student may be removed from a class include but are not limited to; disruptive behavior, disrespectful behavior to other students or staff, or if their skills do not align with the class level to the point that they hinder the learning of the other students.</p>
        <p>No refunds or credits will be given if your student is removed from their class. If the student was removed from the class due to being in the wrong class level, we will attempt to transfer them to the correct level. If there is no space available in the correct level, the student will be removed from the current session but will maintain their priority registration status for the upcoming session. </p>
        <h5>DROP POLICY</h5>
        <p>Families may request to drop the session by 12:00 pm (noon) on Friday prior to the session start date. Drop requests must be submitted via email to waveswimschool@waveaquatics.org. The session start date is always the first Monday of the session, regardless of which day of the week your lesson falls on.</p>
        <h5>REFUND POLICY</h5>
        <p>Refunds will only be granted for drop requests submitted within the parameters listed in the above “Drop Policy”. No other refunds will be granted for swim lessons.</p>

        <h3>What if I miss a class?</h3>
        <p>If your student will be missing a class for medical reasons, you can contact us to have their absence excused and receive a credit for that class. The process for establishing medically excused absences is explained in more detail in the Wave Swim School Student Policies.</p>
        <p>The only other way to get an excused absence is if your student’s absence falls under the conditions of our Religious Holiday Policy. Please refer to the Wave Swim School Student Policies for more information on absences due to religious holidays. Any other absences will be considered unexcused, and will not qualify for any credits. </p>

        <h3>How do waitlists work with sessions?</h3>
        <p>If you register for a session class that is already full, you will be put on the waitlist for that class. If one of the active enrollments decides to drop before the start of the session, we will contact students on the waitlist to fill the open spot. All waitlist enrollments will be dropped at the end of the session. This means that there will no longer be long waitlists to get into lessons. Families will have a new chance every session to register for lessons.</p>

      <section id="WSC8">
        <h3>How does registration work?</h3>
        <p>Registration Week will always be Monday through Sunday the week before the session start date (the first Monday of the session).

        </p>
        <p><strong>PRIORITY REGISTRATION:</strong>   Monday - Tuesday of Registration Week

        <p><strong>REDMOND RESIDENT REGISTRATION</strong>   Wednesday of Registration Week
	    <br>
          The Redmond resident registration will only apply at the Redmond Pool. This day of registration will be for families that are residents of the city of Redmond.

        <h3>How do student evaluations work in swim lessons?</h3>
        <p>Students in lessons receive feedback after every lesson on their skills. Star ratings are entered, which you can view through your account in the customer portal.</p>
        <p>During the third week of the session, students will also receive a comment with their star ratings. This comment will tell you which level to enroll your student in for the next session, and will include feedback for the skills they need to work on.</p>

      </section>
            <hr>

      <section id="WSC11">
        <h3>How do I see my student's evaluations?</h3>
        <p>You can find your student’s evaluations in the customer portal by clicking “My Account” and then clicking the “Evaluations” button for the student you are looking at. You will be able to see star ratings (1-5 stars) for each of the skills in that class level, along with written comments from the instructor. The comments during week three of the session will let you know which level to enroll in for the next session.</p>

            <hr>

      <section id="WSC12">
        <h3>How will I know when it is time to move my student to a new level?</h3>
        <p>During the third week of the session, deck managers complete evaluations for the students who are potentially ready to move up. In the comments of your student's evaluation in week three, the instructor will tell you which level to enroll in for the next session. You will receive an email with your student's evaluation during week three, so you know which level to enroll in when registration opens in week four.</p>
        <p><em>Please remember that most students will take 3 to 8 sessions to pass a level, and it is expected for students to stay at the same level for multiple sessions. </em></p>
